        "The Odyssey", written by Homer, has a character who is a bad leader, his name is Odysseus, the time is set after the Trojan War, and some exambples of bad leadership by him, are: 1) Leading his men into the Cyclops' Cave, 2) He sleeps every time something bad is about to happen, and 3) He eventually leads all but him from his ship, to their death.

        Have you have ever wondered if Odyesseus is a good leader? First of all, we know that he fought in the Trojan War, but not as a leader. As I have said, Odyesseus was not a leader in the Trojan War, but also when he was a leader in arriving back to Ithica, he seemed to be asleep everytime something bad is about to happen. Three examples of bad leadership occurences by Odysseus, are leading his men into the Cyclops Cave, as we said before, sleeping when something bad is about to happen, and lastly, he leads his men to basically death, by being careless about information about the Sun god, Helios' property, which resulted in Zeus destroying their ship with a lightning bolt.
