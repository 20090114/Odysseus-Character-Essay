        "The Odyssey", written by Homer, has a character who is a bad leader, his name is Odysseus, the time is set after the Trojan War, and some exambples of bad leadership by him, are: 1) Leading his men into the Cyclops' Cave, 2) He sleeps every time something bad is about to happen, and 3) He eventually leads all but him from his ship, to their death.

        Have you have ever wondered if Odyesseus is a good leader? First of all, we know that he fought in the Trojan War, but not as a leader. As I have said, Odyesseus was not a leader in the Trojan War, but also when he was a leader in arriving back to Ithica, he seemed to be asleep everytime something bad is about to happen. Three examples of bad leadership occurences by Odysseus, are leading his men into the Cyclops Cave, as we said before, sleeping when something bad is about to happen, and lastly, he leads his men to basically death, by being careless about information about the Sun god, Helios' property, which resulted in Zeus destroying their ship with a lightning bolt.

        First off, near the beginning of "The Odyssey", Odysseus leads his men into the Cyclops Cave and doing that leads into trouble. They drink the Cyclops' wine, which makes him upset, so much, that he locks them in his cave, and eats the men. There were other things that made the Cyclops upset. We know one thing that they did, but there is so much more. First off, Odysseus and his men, eat the Cyclops' livestock. That happened before they even went into the cave. That then got succeded by, some of Odyesseus' men getting eaten by the Cyclops, Which that event happenend inside the cave after they got locked inside of it. Here is an example from the story, which is on page <!--INSERT PAGE NUMBER-->, in the epic "The Odyssey": <!-- INSERT QUOTE HERE -->. First we looked at the Cyclops Cave, now we will look at bad sleeping habbits.

        Another reason that Odysseus is a pretty bad leader, is that he seems to be asleep when something bad is happening, or is about to happen. A few examples of this are, sleeping while one of his men persuades the rest of his men to eat Helios' livestock. Also, he has slept when his men were actually eating Helios' livestock. Finally he was alseep while they were at Circe's island. An example of his bad sleeping habbits from the story is on page <!--INSERT PAGE NUMBER-->, in the epic "The Odyssey": <!-- INSERT QUOTE HERE -->. We just looked at Odysseus' bad sleeping habbits, Finally, we will look at his ship getting destroyed right after his men ate the sun god's livestock.

        The last bad leadership example, is Odysseus' ship getting "struck twice" by lightning. First of all, Odyssesus did not tell his men, that they would all die. I think they would've liked to know that. Next, he did not tell his men about the monsters that would firstly kill some of his men at first. Finally, he ignored his men eating the livestock, which was also the time that he was sleeping, which we talked about earlier. Here is the last example from the story, for this reasoning, that is on the page <!--INSERT PAGE NUMBER-->, in the epic "The Odyssey": <!-- INSERT QUOTE HERTE-->.
      </div.a>
        <br>
      <div.a>
        Those were the three strongest examples of why Odysseus was a bad leader. First off, he lead his men into the Cyclops Cave, next he has bad sleeping habbits, and lastly, he ignores his men, and finally gets his ship destroyed by Zeus. This concludes that Odysseus was not fit for the job of leadership, of leading his men back home. Just because you fought in a major war, does not mean you are fit to be a leader.
